I.Median of the dataset is the the dataset which is present in the middle of the all the dataset The median is a robust measure of central tendency that is not affected by extreme values.  Mode is the data which have maximum number of frequency in all of the dataset The mode provides information about the most common values in a dataset. It is suitable for both numerical and categorical data, and a dataset can be unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal."
